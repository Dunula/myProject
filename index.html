        <p id="p1">Arduino is an open-source electronics 
            platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. 
            Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, 
            a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into 
            an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online.</p>

            <p id="uno_p">The Arduino Uno is an open-source microcontroller board based on the 
                Microchip ATmega328P microcontroller and developed by Arduino.cc and 
                initially released in 2010. The board is equipped with sets of digital 
                and analog input/output pins that may be interfaced to various expansion boards and other circuits.</p>

            <p id="nano_p">The Arduino Nano is a small, complete, and breadboard-friendly 
                board based on the ATmega328 (Arduino Nano 3. x). It has more or less the 
                same functionality of the Arduino Duemilanove, but in a different package. 
                It lacks only a DC power jack, and works with a Mini-B USB cable instead of a standard one.</p>
